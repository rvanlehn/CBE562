Molecules are confined with a simulation box and move according to Newton's equation of motion; since this requires calculations of forces and velocities, the pressure and temperature can also be computed for every simulation configuration.\n",

The plot below shows the values that would be obtained from a longer version of the simulation above.

Doing so yields the following (unnormalized histogram). For comparison, a Gaussian fit to the distribution is drawn as a line and a vertical dashed line indicates the average value of the Gaussian distribution.\n",

Accordingly, the temporal fluctuations observed in the plot of pressure vs. time are related to the width of the underlying distribution."
